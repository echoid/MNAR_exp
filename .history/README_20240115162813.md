2. Run```create_missing.ipynb```
   Create Missing Masks, include missing rate

3. Run ```create_visualization.ipynb```
   Create Missing Mech ScatterPlot, Missing Rate Plot, Missing Distribution Plot

4. Run models
   Under Model folders, each model will create a train and test data
   ```mean.ipynb``` Mean Value imputation from Sklearn

5. Run Evaluation
   RMSE
   Downstream
