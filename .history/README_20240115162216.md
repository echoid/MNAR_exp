1. Run ```create_data.ipynb```: load raw data, do the normalization, and do the datasplit of each data.
   datalist : [

       2. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
       3. curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
       4. entropy of image (continuous)

            "connectionist_bench_sonar","qsar_biodegradation",
            "yeast","yacht_hydrodynamics"
            ]

2. Run```create_missing.ipynb```
   Create Missing Masks, include missing rate

3. Run ```create_visualization.ipynb```
   Create Missing Mech ScatterPlot, Missing Rate Plot, Missing Distribution Plot

4. Run models
   Under Model folders, each model will create a train and test data
   ```mean.ipynb``` Mean Value imputation from Sklearn

5. Run Evaluation
   RMSE
   Downstream
